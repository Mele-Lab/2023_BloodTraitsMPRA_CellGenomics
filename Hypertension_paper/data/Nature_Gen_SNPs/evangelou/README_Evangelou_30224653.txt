Evangelou E et al. Genetic analysis of over 1 million people identifies 535 new loci associated with blood pressure traits. Nat Genet. 2018;50(12):1755Files include data from our N~750k discovery meta-analysis of both UKB and ICBP, for all ~7 million post-QC SNPs imputed from the HRC ref panel, which were common to both the UKB and ICBP datasets.Column headers of results files are as follows:-          MarkerName – CHR:POS:TYPE where POS is NCBI build 37/hg19 and TYPE is SNP or INDEL-          Allele1 – the Effect Allele-          Allele2 – the other Allele-          Freq1 – frequency of effect allele A1-          Effect – effect of Allele 1, on the untransformed mmHg scale-          StdErr – SE of Beta-          P – p-value-          TotalSampleSize – total analysed N (i.e. max ~750k)-          N_effective – effective sample size = N * imp.Quality
