For the fasta file run:

awk '{print ">" $19 "_" $2 "\t" $1}' design/Hypertension__pooled.index.txt > Hypertension__pooled.index.fasta

sort Hypertension__pooled.index.fasta | uniq > Hypertension__pooled.index.seq.uniq

awk '{print $1 "\n" $2}' Hypertension__pooled.index.seq.uniq > Hypertension__pooled.index.fasta

Then: head -n -2 Hypertension__pooled.index.fasta > Hypertension__pooled.index.fa

Kaia's files were downloaded from her github after clear explanations from an email on how to run FIMO

FIMO command from Kaia:
fimo --o out_dir human_cisbp_pfms.txt elements.fasta

" it should spit out a file called fimo.txt that has all the results; then you can just look for motifs that are unique to either allele."
